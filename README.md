# About this repo

This is my fork of [second-state/ssvm-nodejs-starter](https://github.com/second-state/ssvm-nodejs-starter) to learn using WebAssembly, Rust and the SSVM.
The Rust function calculates the next prime number, the algorithm is based on this [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primality_test#Pseudocode).

To run this application, fork this repo and use SSVM's docker container to build and run.

## Use Docker to build and run

```
$ docker pull secondstate/ssvm-nodejs-starter:v1
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 --rm -it -v $(pwd):/app secondstate/ssvm-nodejs-starter:v1
(docker) # cd /app
(docker) # ssvmup build
(docker) # node node/app
```

From a second terminal window, you can test the local server.
```
$ curl -d 'n=7' http://localhost:3000/next
11
```

or open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Resources

* [The Second State VM (SSVM)](https://github.com/second-state/ssvm) is a high performance [WebAssembly virtual machine](https://www.secondstate.io/ssvm/) designed for server-side applications.
* [The SSVM NPM addon](https://github.com/second-state/ssvm-napi) provides access to the SSVM, and programs in it, through a Node.js host application.
* [The SSVM ready tool, ssvmup](https://github.com/second-state/ssvmup) is a [toolchain](https://www.secondstate.io/articles/ssvmup/) for compiling Rust programs into WebAssembly, and then make them accessible from JavaScripts via the SSVM.
